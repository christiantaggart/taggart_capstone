- Collect skills (Software Languages)
  - [x]Software emblems around the campus level up skills
    - [x] Software Emblems Drop Skill
  - [x] Add score (GUI)
  - [ ] reach levels (Shown in GUI)
    - [ ] rank up:

      - Sr. Developer ➡️
      - _**(Option)**_ Some funny developer at the top rank (Jobs, GATES,(silicon valley: Jian-Yang, Dinesh, Steven Hendrix)

### Actual Game Play:
I needed some sort of struggle to gain skills, I came up with the following:
  - Software Emblems Randomly traverse the map, then when you approach them them come towards you.



##### Example:
- MainCharacter collides with GameObject(skills) and gain points.
  - HTML = 100 points
  - CSS = 25 points
  - JavaScript GameObject collision = 200 points
    (Go through javascript tools)
    - Node = 125
    - knex = 50
    - Express = 100
    - Angular = 100
    - React = 150
  - Database:
    - Postgres = 100 score
    - MongoDB = 125
  - Other Languages
    - Python as Large snake must be defeated with keyboard mashing or something shooting fat arrows
      - Gain 200 points
    - C gain 250 points
    - Shell 1,000,000 points


##### NEED TO Build:
- [ ] Galvanize Campus.
- [ ] Characters
- [x] Env
- [ ] Language GameObjects (Similar to their emblem /  Monsters derived from their emblem)
