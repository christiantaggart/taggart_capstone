# Project Log
### This is the process I took to create my project

#### Back story
Recently I was exposed to the Unity Game engine and I had the choice of using JavaScript or C#. All my life I've wanted to develop video games and my favorite game engines are built on C++. So I decided to opt for something that might place me closer to my goal of learning a true "Lower-Level" Programming language. I started Writing scripts for Unity in C# and I have been excited to create code using C# ever since.

I wanted to continue building my understanding of C# so I decided to create a Website where I could get to practice my new favorite programming language and also be able to present a web-app because thats what this Galvanize Immersive was focused on

#### Onto some tech:


#### Installing ASP.NET CORE
- I installed dotnet version 1.0.4

#### I then installed a Single Page Application template engine [Source](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2017/02/14/building-single-page-applications-on-asp-net-core-with-javascriptservices/)
```sh
dotnet new --install Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates::*
```

#### Front-End
While keeping my my time constraints in mind. I still chose to pick a new Front-End Framework as well as a completely new language to me.
My options were Angular 4, Aurelia, Knockout, React and React with Redux.

While I really wanted to use React with Redux after doing a build and noticing just how different the workflow was I made the decision to switch to Angular 4.
I really like the Chrome extensions that work with react though and I look forward to developing with it in the future.

- I am using Angular version 4.1.2

"Publishing for deployment
To deploy your application to production, you can use the publish feature which is built into dotnet command line tooling and Visual Studio. For example, on the command line, run:"

```sh
dotnet publish -c Release
```
"This will produce a ready-to-deploy production build of your application. It includes .NET code compiled in Release mode, and invokes Webpack with the --env.prod flag to produce a production build of front-end assets. Equivalently, you can use the Publish option from Visual Studioâ€™s Build menu."
